My first try at React Native. Used Expo to create the project and set up a basic set of pages. Nothing added to them yet, as I am trying to decide which direction to head into. The weather page is set up and creating a 3 day forecast for Asheville, NC, which is where this app would've been used. I followed a tutorial on setting that up. 

 The Splash Screen is very basic and I'll look to implement a better look. Login isn't tied to anything yet. NavigationOptions is set up to flow between the pages, with the use of a "back button" in the works.
